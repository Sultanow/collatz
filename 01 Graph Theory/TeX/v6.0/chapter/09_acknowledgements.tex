%TODO: use nameref instead of repeating the section title
Mathematics is not the easiest discipline. Mistakes happen quickly and symbols, formulas or definitions can sometimes appear contradictory in the literature. The ambiguity/overriding of the notation for powers of an ideal and for the repeated direct product of a ring is only one example. All the more we are grateful for the numerous help from mathematics communities like the \hyperlink{https://math.stackexchange.com}{Stack Exchange Network}, the \hyperlink{https://www.matheboard.de}{MatheBoard Community}, and \hyperlink{https://matheplanet.com}{Matroids Matheplanet}. As an example let us mention \hyperlink{https://math.stackexchange.com/users/242/bill-dubuque}{Bill Dubuque}, for whose instant help in matters of abstract algebra we are very grateful as for the help by many other kind people from the math communities.

We would like to thank Jan Kleinnijenhuis and Alissa M. Kleinnijenhuis for the interesting conversations, which we are still maintaining and for proofreading our chapter on binary trees and for the interesting input on pruning these trees, which we incorporated into our research.
