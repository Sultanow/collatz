Mathematics is not the easiest discipline. Mistakes happen quickly and symbols, formulas or definitions can sometimes appear contradictory in the literature. The ambiguity/overriding of the notation for powers of an ideal and for the repeated direct product of a ring is only an example. All the more we are grateful for the numerous help from mathematics communities like the \hyperlink{https://math.stackexchange.com/}{Stack Exchange Network}, the \hyperlink{https://www.matheboard.de/}{MatheBoard Community}, and \hyperlink{https://matheplanet.com/}{Matroids Matheplanet}.
